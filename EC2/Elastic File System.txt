- It is a file storage service for Amazon EC2 instances.

- Easy to use and provide simple interface that allows you to create and configure file systems quickly and easily.

- With Amazon EFS, storage capacity is elastic, growing and shrinking automatically as you add and remove files, so our applications have storage they need, when they need it.

- Supports Network File System version 4 (NFSv4) protocol.

- We can pay for storage we use(no pre-provisioning required.)

- Can scale up to petabytes.

- Can support thousands of concurrent NFS connections.

- Data is stored across multiple AZ's within a region.

- Read after write consistency.
