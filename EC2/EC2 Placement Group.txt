EC2 Placement Groups

Types: 

- Clustered Placement Group
- Spread Placement Group

1. Clustered Placement Group

A cluster placement group of instances within single availability Zone. Placement groups are recommended for applications that need low network latency, high network throughput, or both.

Only certain instances can be launched in to a Clustered Placement group.

2. Spread placement Group

It is a group of instances that are each placed on distinct underlying hardware.

Recommended for applications that have small number of critical instances that should be kept seperate from each other.


- Clustered placement group can't span multiple Availability Zones whereas Spread placement group can.

- Name of placement group must be unique within your AWS account.

- Only certain type of instance can be launched in placement group (Compute optimized, GPU, Memory Optimized, Storage optimized)

- AWS recomends homogenous instances within placement groups.

- We can merge placement groups.

- We can't move an existing instance into placement group. We can create an AMI from your existing instance, and then launch a new instance from AMI into a placement group.
