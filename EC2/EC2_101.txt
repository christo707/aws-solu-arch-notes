- Termination Protection is turned off by default, we must turn it on.

- On a EBS-backed instance, the default action is for the root EBS volume to be deleted when the instance is terminated.

- EBS Root Volumes of default AMI's cannot be encrypted. We can use third party tool (like bit locker) to encrypt root volume.

- Additional volumes can be encrypted.
