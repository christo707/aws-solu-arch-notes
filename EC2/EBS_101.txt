EBS (Elastic Block Store)

- Provides persistent block storage volumes for use with Amazon EC2Instances.

- EBS is virtual harddisk drive for EC2 instance

- Each EBS volume is automatically replicated within AZ to protect you from component failure, offering high availability and durability.

Five Different Types:

- General Purpose (SSD)
- Provisioned IOPS (SSD) (Really fast input output)
- Throughput optimised Hard Disk Drive (Physical drives so magnetic)
- Cold Hard Disk Drive (Magnetic)
- Magnetic
_________________________________________________________

- We can create a snapshot of an EBS and then create an AMI to migrate the EBS to new EC2 instance.

- We can use AMI to migrate EC2 to different region also.

- Additional volumes attached to EC2 instance will persist  even aver EC2 instance is terminated.

- Snapshots exist on S3. Snapshots are photograph of the disk. They are point in time copies of Volumes.

- Snapshots are incremental - only blocks that have changed since last snapshot are moved to S3.

- If this is your first snapshot, it may take some time to create.

- To create a snapshot for Amazon EBS volumes that serve as root devices, you should stop instance before taking snapshot. However we can still take snapshot while the instance is running.

- We can create AMI's from both Volumes and snapshots.

- We can change EBS volume size on fly.

- Volumes will Always be in same availability zone a EC2 instance 
__________________________________________________________

Two types of AMI:

- EBS
- Instance Store

For EBS Volumes: Root device for an instance launced from the AMI is an Amazon EBS Volume created from an Amazon EBS snapshot.

For Instance Store Volumes: Root device for an instance launched from AMI is an instance store volume created from a template stored in Amazon S3.

- Instance Store Volumes are sometimes call Ephemeral Storage.

- Instance Store Volumes cannot be stopped. If the underlying host fails, you will lose your data.

- EBS backed Volumes can be stopped. If the underlying host fails, we will not lose our data.

- We can reboot both, we will not lose our data.

- By default, both ROOT volumes will be deleted on termination. However, with EBS volumes, you can tell AWS to keep root device volume.

-?? When we reboot EBS backed AMI it can start on different hypervisor but we cannot do that in Instance backed AMI.

_________________________________________________________

Encrypted root device Volumes and snapshots.

- Create a snapshot of volume. Can create onlu unencrypted.

- Copy this snapshot and encrypt this on copying.

- A Encryptrd Copy of snapshot is created.

- Copy of encrypted snap will always be encrypted.

- Create a encrypted AMI from this encrypted snapshot.

- If we launch an instance from this we will get an EC2 with encrypted root volume. 

- We can share snapshots only if they are unencrypted.

- Thes snapshots can be shared with other AWS accounts or made public.
