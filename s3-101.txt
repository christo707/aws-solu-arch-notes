S3 (Simple Storage Service)

- Provides durable, highly-scalable object storage.
- Safe place to store files. Object-based storage.
- Files can be from 0bytes to 5 TB.
- Unlimited storage.
- Stored in Buckets.

(christo is name of bucket, have to be unique)

* Data Consistency Model

- Read after Write consistency for PUTS of new Objects.
- Eventual Consistency for overwrite PUTS and DELETE(can take some time to propagate becaue it is spread to various regions)

* S3 is simple Key-value Store
- Key (Name of object)
- Value (Data and is made of seuence of bytes)
- Version ID (important for versioning)
- Metadata (Data about data you are storing).
- Subresources:
  - Access Control Lists (individual file permission)
  - Torrent

- Amazon grarantee 99.9% availability
- Amazon guarantees 99.99999999999 durability for s3 information (11 x 9s).
- Tiered Storage Available
- Lifecycle Management

* S3 Storage Tiers/CLasses

# S3 Standard: 99.99 % availability, 99.99999999999% durability. Stored redundantly across multiple devices in multiple facilities and is designed to sustain loss of 2 facilities concurrently.

# S3-IA: (Infrequently Accessed): For data not accessed frequently, But require rapid access when needed. Lower fee than s3 but will be charged retreival fee. Stored redundantly across multiple devices in multiple facilities.

# S3 One Zone - IA: Lower cost option for infrequently used data, do not require multiple Availability zone data resilience. Can be used for data which is easily reproducible.

# Glacier: Very Cheap, but used for archival only. Expedited(restored in few minutes), Standard(restored in 3 - 5 hrs) or bulk(taes 10 - 12 hrs). Standard retrieval time takes 3 - 5 hours.
