S3 (Simple storage service)

- Provides secure, durable, highly scalable object storage.

- Safe place to store files.

- Data is spread across multiple facilities.

- Files 0 bytes to 5 TB.

- Unlimited storage.

- Files are stored in Buckets(folder).

- S3 is a universal namespace. i.e.., bucket names should be unique.

- HTTP 200 for successfull file upload.

- Not suitable to install operating system or a database.

______________________________________________________

- Objects consist of foloowing:

1. Key (name of object)

2. Value (File data which is sequence of bytes.)

3. Version ID (for versioning)

4. Metadata (data about data which we are storing)

5. Subresources:
	Access Control Lists 
	Torrent

How does data consistency work for s3?

Ans: 
- Read after Write consistency for PUTS of new objects. 
- Eventual Consistency for overwrite PUTS and DELETES (can take some time to propagate)

S3 guarantees:

- Built for 99.99% availability 
- 99.9% availability
- 99.99999999999% (11x9s) durability

- Tiered storage Available
- Lifecycle Management
- Versioning
- Encrption
- MFA Delete
- Secure data using Access Control Lists and Bucket Policies.

Different Storage Classes

1. S3 Standard
99.99%availability, 99.99999999999% durability, stored redundantly across multiple devices in multiple facilities, and is designed to sustain the loss of 2 facilities concurrently.

2. S3 - IA(Infrequently Accessed):
For data that is accessed less frequently, but requires rapid access when needed. Lower fee than S3, but charged retrieval fee.

3. S3 One Zone - IA  or RRS(Reduced Redudancy storage)
Low cost option. Not required multiple availability zone.

4. S3- Intelligent Tiering
Designed to optimize costs by automatically moving data to most cost-effective access tier, without performance impact or operation overhead.

5. S3 Glacier
Data archiving. Retrieval time is from minutes to hours

6. S3 Glacier Deep Archive
Lowest cost. Retrieval time is 12 hours.

Charged for:

- Storage

- Requests (Retreival frequency)

- Storage management pricing (Different Tiers)

- Data Transfer Pricing

- Transfer Acceleration 
(To enable fast, easy and secure transfers of files over long distances between your end users and an S3 bucket.
	Takes advantage of Amazon Cloudfront's globally distributed edge locations.)

- Cross Region Replication Pricing (copy data from one bucket to another in different location)
