CloudFront:

It is a content delivery network (CDN), a system of distributed servers (network) that deliver webpages and other web content to a user based on geographic locations of the user, the origin of webpage, and content delivery server.

Edge Location: Location where content will be cached. Seperate to an AWS Region/AZ.

Origin: This is origin of files that CDN will distribute. This can be S3 Bucket, an Ec2 instance, an Elastic load balancer or Route53.

Distribution: This is name given the CDN which consists of a collection of Edge Locations.

Web Distribution: Typically used for websites.

RTMP: Used for Media Streaming.

- Edge locations are not just READ only - you can write to them too (i.e.., put an object on to them.)

- Objects are cached for the life of TTL (Time to live.)

- You can clear cached objects, but you will be charged.
