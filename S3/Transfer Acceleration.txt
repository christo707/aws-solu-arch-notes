S3 Transfer Acceleration

S3 Transfer Acceleration utilises the cloudFront Edge Network to accelerate your uploads to S3.

Instead of uploading directly your S3 bucket, you can use a distinct URL to upload directly to an edge location which will then transfer to S3 bucket.

You will get distinct URL to upload to:
eg: acloudguru.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com
