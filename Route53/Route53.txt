- We can buy domain name directly from AWS.

Routing policy available with Route53:

- Simple Routing

- Weighted Routing

- Latency-based Routing

- Failover Routing

- Geolocation Routing

- Geolocation Routing

- Geoproximity Routing (Traffic flow only)

- Multivalue Answer Routing

__________________________________________________________

Simple Routing Policy

We can have one record with multiple IP address. We can specify multiple values in a record, Route53 returns all values to user in a random order.

- Meaning: One DNS has multiple IP address. Each request to an DNS get a random IP from the list of IP.

__________________________________________________________

Weighted Routing Policy

- Allows to split traffic based on different weights assigned.

- For example, we can set 10% of traffic to go to us-east-1 and 90% to go to eu-west-1.

Health Check- 

- We can set health checks on individual record sets.

- If record fails a health check it will be removed from Route53 until it passes the health check.

- We can also set SNS notifications to alert if a health check is failed.

__________________________________________________________

Latency Based Routing

- Allows you to route your traffic based on lowest network latency for end user (i.e.., which region will give them fastest resonse time).

- To use it we create latency resource record set for EC2 resource in each region that hosts your website. 
When Route 53 receives a query, it selects latency record set which gives user lowest latency. Route 53 then responds with value associated with that resource record set.

__________________________________________________________

Failover Routing policy

- It is used when we want to create an active/passice set up. For eg. we may want our primary site to be in eu-west-2 and our secondary DR Site in ap-southeast-2.

- Route 53 will monitor health of our primary site using a health check.

- A health check monitors health of our end points.

- If our active site fails Route 53 redirects traffic to our passice website.

__________________________________________________________

Geolocation Routing Policy

- It lets you choose where your traffic will be sent based on geographic location of users (i.e.., location where DNS queries originate).

- Eg., We might all queries from europe to be routed to EC2 instances configured for European customers. These instances may have local language of your European customers and all prices are displayed in Euros.

__________________________________________________________

Geoproximity Routin Policy (Traffic flow only)

- Geoproximity routing lets Amazon Route 53 route traffic to your resources based on geographic location of your users and your resources.

- You can also optionally choose to route more traffic or less to a given resource by specifying a value, known as a bias. A Bias expands or shrinks the size of geographic region from which traffic is routed to a resource.

__________________________________________________________

Multivalue Answer Routing Policy

- Multivalue answer routing lets you configure Amazon Route 53 to return multiple values, such as IP addresses for your web servers, in response to DNS queries. 

- We can specify multiple values for almost any record, but multivalue answer routing also lets you check health of each resource, so Route 53 returns only values for healthy resources.

- Similar to simple routing policy however it allows to pust health check on each record set.
