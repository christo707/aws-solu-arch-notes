- We can buy domain name directly from AWS.

Routing policy available with Route53:

- Simple Routing

- Weighted Routing

- Latency-based Routing

- Failover Routing

- Geolocation Routing

- Geolocation Routing

- Geoproximity Routing (Traffic flow only)

- Multivalue Answer Routing

__________________________________________________________

Simple Routing Policy

We can have one record with multiple IP address. We can specify multiple values in a record, Route53 returns all values to user in a random order.

- Meaning: One DNS has multiple IP address. Each request to an DNS get a random IP from the list of IP.

__________________________________________________________

Weighted Routing Policy

- Allows to split traffic based on different weights assigned.

- For example, we can set 10% of traffic to go to us-east-1 and 90% to go to eu-west-1.

Health Check- 

- We can set health checks on individual record sets.

- If record fails a health check it will be removed from Route53 until it passes the health check.

- We can also set SNS notifications to alert if a health check is failed.

__________________________________________________________

Latency Based Routing

- Allows you to route your traffic based on lowest network latency for end user (i.e.., which region will give them fastest resonse time).

- To use it we create latency resource record set for EC2 resource in each region that hosts your website. 
When Route 53 receives a query, it selects latency record set which gives user lowest latency. Route 53 then responds with value associated with that resource record set.

__________________________________________________________

Failover Routing policy

- It is used when we want to create an active/passice set up. For eg. we may want our primary site to be in eu-west-2 and our secondary DR Site in ap-southeast-2.

- Route 53 will monitor health of our primary site using a health check.

- A health check monitors health of our end points.

- If our active site fails Route 53 redirects traffic to our passice website.
