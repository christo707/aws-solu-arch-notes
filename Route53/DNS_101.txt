DNS:

- It is used for converting human friendly domain names( like http://acloud.guru) into an Internet Protocal (IP) address (such as http://82.124.53.1)

- IP addresses are used by computers to identify each other on network. IP addresses community come in 2 different forms, IPv4 and IPv6.

- The A record maps a name to one or more IP addresses when the IP are known and stable.

- The CNAME record maps a name to another name. It should only be used when there are no other records on that name.

- The ALIAS record maps a name to another name, but can coexist with other records on that name.

- The A name must resolve to an IP. The CNAME and ALIAS records must point to a name.


Common DNS types:

- SOA Records: A start of authority (SOA) record is information stored in a domain name system (DNS) zone about that zone and about other DNS records.

- NS Records: NS stands for 'name server' and this record indicates which DNS server is authoritative for that domain (which server contains the actual DNS records). A domain will often have multiple NS records which can indicate primary and backup name servers for that domain.

- A Record

- CNAMES

- MX Records: A mail exchanger record (MX record) specifies the mail server responsible for accepting email messages on behalf of a domain name. 

- PTR records: They are used for the Reverse DNS (Domain Name System) lookup. Using the IP address you can get the associated domain/hostname.
