- IAM is global it doesnot deppend on region.

- Access key Id and Secret Access key for progmatically access

- A policy is an object in AWS that, when associated with an entity or resource, defines their permissions.

- AWS evaluates these policies when a principal, such as a user, makes a request. Permissions in the policies determine whether the request is allowed or denied. Most policies are stored in AWS as JSON documents.

- IAM roles are a secure way to grant permissions to entities that you trust. 
Examples of entities include the following:

* IAM user in another account

* Application code running on an EC2 instance that needs to perform actions on AWS resources

* An AWS service that needs to act on resources in your account to provide its features.

* Users from a corporate directory who use identity federation with SAML

IAM roles issue keys that are valid for short durations, making them a more secure way to grant access.

- Billing alarm can be set through billing dashboard. It uses cloudwatch

Summary

IAM consist of the following:

- Users
- Groups (A way to group our users and apply policies to them collectively)
- Roles (To grant permission for a service to use another service.)
- Policy Documents (JSON object gives info of permissions)
