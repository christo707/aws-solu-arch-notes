- Nat Instance
EC2 Instance

- Nat Gateway
Highly availale gateway which allow our private subnet to comunicate to internet

- Disable source and receiver check for NAT instance to make a gateway.

____________________________________________

- When creating a NAT instance, Disale Source/Destination Check on the Instance.

- NAT instances must be in a pubic subnet.

- There must be a route out of private subnet to NAT instance, in order for this to work.

- Amount of traffic that NAT instances can support depends on instances size. If you are bottlenecking, increase the instance size.

- We can create high availability using Autoscaling Groups, multiple subnets in different AZs, and script to automate failover.

- Nat Instance is behind a Security group.

NAT Gateways

- Redundant inside AZ

- Preferred by enterprise.

- Starts at 5Gbps and scale currently to 45Gbps.

- No need to patch OS.

- Not associated with security Group.

- Automatically assigned a public IP address.

- Remember to update your route tables.
