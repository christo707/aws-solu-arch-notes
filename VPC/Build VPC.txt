- When we create VPC we create route table, ACL and security group.

- New VPC won't create any subnets, nor will create a default internet gateway.

- US-East-1A in one aws account can be completely different availability zone to US-East-1A in another aws account. The AZ's are randamized.

- Amazon always reserve 5 IP addresses within your subnets.

- We can have 1 Internet Gateway per VPC.

- Security Groups can't span VPCs.

- We cannot connect to Internet through our private subnet EC2, we will do this through NAT (Network Address Translation)

Thanks for opportunity.
I was interested in React project but was not looking for plain javascript front end project. I will try to find some backend or cloud development project.
