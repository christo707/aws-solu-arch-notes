- Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) lets you provision a logically isolated section of AWS cloud where you can launch aws resources in a virtual network that you define.

- You have complete control over your virtual networking environment, including section of your own IP address range, creation of subnets, and configuration of route tables and network gateways.

__________________________________________________________

What can we do with a VPC?

- Launch instances into a subnet of your choosing.

- Assign custom IP address ranges in each subnet.

- Configure route tables between subnets.

- Create internet gateway and attach it to our VPC

- Much better security control over our AWS resources

- Instance security groups.

- Subnet network access control lists (ACLS)

__________________________________________________________

Default VPC vs Custom VPC

- Default VPC is user friendly, allowing to immediately deploy instances.

- All subnets in default VPC have a route out to the internet.

- Each EC2 instance has both a  public and private IP address.

__________________________________________________________

VPC Peering

- Allows you to connect one VPC with another via a direct network route using private IP addresses.

- Instances behave as if they were on same private network.

- We can peer VPC with another AWS account as well as with other VPC in same account.

- Peering is in a star configuration i.e.., 1 central VPC peers with 4 other.
NO TRANSITIVE PEERING!!!

- We can peer between regions

__________________________________________________________

- Think of VPC as a logical datacenter in AWS.

- Consist of IWG (or virtual private Gateways), Route tables, Network Access Control Lists, Subnets, and security Groups.

- 1 Subnet = 1 Availability Zone

- Security group are stateful, Network Access Control Lists are Stateless

- No Transitive Peering
