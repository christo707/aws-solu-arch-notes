- On provisioning a load balancer we need to public subnet.

VPC FLow logs

- It is a feature that enables yu to capture information about IP traffic going to and from network interfaces in your VPC. Stored in Amazon CloudWatch Logs. 

- We cannot enable flow logs for VPCs that are peered with your VPC unless the peer VPC is in your account.

- We cannot tag a flow log.

- After we have created a flow log, we cannot change its configuration, for eg, we can't associate a different IAM Role with flow log.

Not All Traffic is monitored.

- Traffic generated by instances when they contact Amazon DNS server. If we use your own DNS server then it will be logged.

- Traffic generated byWindows instance for Amazon Windows liscence activation.

- Traffic to and from 169.254.169.254 for instance metadata.

- DHCP traffic.

- Traffic to reserved IP address for default VPC router.

Bastion Host

- A NAT Gateway or NAT instance is used to provide internet traffic to EC2 instances in a private subnets.

- A Bastion is used to securely administer EC2 instances(Using SSH or RDP) in private subnet. Also called Jump Box.

- We cannot use NAT Gateway as a Bastion host.

Direct Connect

- Cloud service solution that makes it easy to establish a dedicated network connection from your premesis to AWS.

- Useful for high throughput workloads (ie lots of network traffic)

- Or if we need a stable and reliable secure connection.

VPC EndPoints

- A VPC endpoint enables you to privately connect your VPC to supported AWS services and VPC endpoint services powered by private link without requiring internet gateway, NAT device, VPN connection, or AWS Direct connect connection. 

- Instances in your VPC do not require IP addresses to communicate with resources in the service. Traffic between your VPC and other service does not leave Amazon Network.

- Endpoints are virtual devices. They are horizontally scaled, redundant, and highly available VPC components that allow communication between instances in your VPC and services without imposing availability risks or bandwidth constraints on your network traffic.

- Two Types:

* Interface Endpoint
	It is an elastic network interface with private IP address that serves as an entry point for traffic destined to a supported service.

* Gateway Endpoint
	For S3 and DynamoDB
