VPC FLow logs

- It is a feature that enables yu to capture information about IP traffic going to and from network interfaces in your VPC. Stored in Amazon CloudWatch Logs. 

- We cannot enable flow logs for VPCs that are peered with your VPC unless the peer VPC is in your account.

- We cannot tag a flow log.

- After we have created a flow log, we cannot change its configuration, for eg, we can't associate a different IAM Role with flow log.

Not All Traffic is monitored.

- Traffic generated byWindows instance for Amazon Windows liscence activation.

- Traffic to and from 169.254.169.254 for instance metadata.
