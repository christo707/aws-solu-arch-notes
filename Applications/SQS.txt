- Visibility Time Out:
	
	Amount of time that message in invisible in SQS queue after reader picks up message. Provided the job is processed before visibility time out expires, the message will then be deleted from queue.
	If job is not processed within that time, message will become visible again and another reader will process it. This could result in same message being delivered twice.
