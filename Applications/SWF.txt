SWF

- Simple workflow service

- Web service to make it easy to coordinate work(tasks) accross distributed application componments.

- Taks represent invocations of various processing steps in an application which can be performed be executable code, web service calls, human actions and scripts.

SWF vs SQS

- SQS has retention period of 14 days, with SWF workflow executions can last upto 1 year.

- SWF is task oriented API, SQS is message oriented API.

- SWF ensures task is assigned only once and is never duplicated. In SQS we need to handle duplicated messages and also need to handle that message is processed only once.

- SWF keeps track of all tasks and events in an application. With SQS we need to implement our own application level tracking, especially if our application uses multiple queues.
