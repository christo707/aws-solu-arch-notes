- Streaming data is data that is generated continously by thousands of data sources, which typically send in data records simultaneously, and in small size (order of kilobytes.)

- Amazon kenesis is a platform on AWS to send your streaming data to.

- Kenesis makies it easy to load and analyze straming data, and also provide ability for you to build your own clustom applications for business needs.

3 Different types:

- Kinesis Streams

- Kinesis Firehose

- Kinesis Analytics

__________________________________________________________

Kinesis Streams Consist of Shards.

- By default stored for 24 hrs to 7 days.

- 5 Transactions per seconds for reads, upto total data read rate of 2 MB per second and upto 1000 records per seconds for writes, up to a maximum total data write rate of 1 MB per second (including partition keys.)

- Data capacity of your stream is a function of number of shards that you specify for stream. Total capacity of stream is sum of capacities of shards.
