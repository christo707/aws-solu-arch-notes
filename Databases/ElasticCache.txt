Elasticache

- It is a web service that makes it easy to deploy, operate, and scale an in memory cache in the cloud. 

- The service improves performance of web applications by allowing to retreive information from fast, managed, in-memory caches, instead of relying entirely on slower disk based databases.

- Supports two caching engines:
* Memcached
* Reddis

- Reddis is multi-AZ

- You can do back ups and restore of Reddis.

- If you need to scale horizontall, use Memcached.
