Relational Databases on AWS (OLTP):

- SQL Server
- Oracle
- MySQL Server
- PostgreSQL
- Aurora
- MariaDB

RDS has two features:

- Multi-AZ: For Disaster Recovery
- Read Replicas - For Performance

NON Relational Databases:

* Collection = Table
* Document = Row
* Key Value Pairs = Fields

Data Warehousing

Used for Business intelligence. Tools like Cognos, Jaspersoft, SQL Server Reporting Services, Oracle Hyperion, SAP NetWeaver.

Used to pull in very large and complex data sets. Usually used by management to do queries on data (such as current performance vs targets etc.)

OLTP vs OLAP

Online Transaction Processing (OLTP) differs from Online Analytics processing (OLAP) in terms of queries you will run.

OLTP pulls a particular record like fetch order with order no 1234

OLAP runs a complex query to get a result like calculate the total profit in sales of radio from Europe Asia and Africa.

- Data Warehousing databases use different type of architecture both from a database perspective and infrastructure level.

- Amazon Data Warehouse Solution is called RedShift.

ElasticCache is a web service that makes it easy to deploy, operate, and scale an in memory cache in cloud. 

- The Serviceimproves performance of web application by allowing to retreive information from fast, managed, in-memory caches, instead of relying entirely on slower-disk based databases.

ElasticCache supports two open-source in-memory caching engines:

* Memcached
* Redis

__________________________________________________________

- RDS on virtual machines.

- We cannot log in to these operating systems however.

- Patching of RDS Operating System and DB is Amazon's responsibility.

- RDS is NOT Serverless.

- Aurora Serverless is serverless.
