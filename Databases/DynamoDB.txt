Dynamo DB

- Fast, flexible NoSQL database service for all applications that need consistent, single digit millisecond latency at any scale.

- Fully managed database and supports both document and key-value data models.

-  Stored on SSD

- Spread on 3 geographically distinct data centres.

- Eventual Consistent Read (Default)

Consistency across all copies of data is usually reached within a second. Repeating a read after a short time should return updated value. (Best REad performance)

- Strong Consistent Read

A strongly consistent read returns a result that reflects all writes that received a successful response prior to the read.
