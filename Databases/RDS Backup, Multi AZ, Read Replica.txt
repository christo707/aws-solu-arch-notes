- Automated Backup allow to recover our database to any point in time within "retention period".

- Retention period can be between 1 day to 35 days.

- Automated Backups will take full daily snapshot and will also store transactional logs throughout the day.

- AWS will first choose the most recent daily backup and then apply transaction logs relevant to that day.

- That allow to point in recovery down to a second, within retention period.

- Automated backup is enabled by default. Backup data is stored in S3 and we get free storage equal to size of our database. 

- Backups are taken in defined window. During that time storage I/O may be suspended while data is backed up and we may experience elevated latency.

__________________________________________________________

DataBase Snapshots:

DB snapshots are done manually. They are stored even after we delete original RDS instance, unlike automated backups.

- Restored database from automated backup or snapshot will be new instance of database with new end point.

Encryption At Rest:

- Encryption at rest is supported for MySQL, ORacle, SQL Server, PostgreSQL, MariaDB & Aurora.

- Done using AWS Key management Service(KMS)

- Once it is encrypted, the data stored is also encrypted, as are its automated backups, read replicas, and snapshots.

__________________________________________________________

Multi AZ

- It makes a exact copy of our database in another AZ. AWS handles replication, when we write to database it is automatically synchronized to stant by DB.

- In event of DB maintenance, DB instance failure, or an AZ failure, AWS RDS will automatically failover to standby so database operations can resume quicky without administrative intervention.

- Multi AZ is for Disaster Recovery (DR).

__________________________________________________________

Read Replica

- It allow to have read only copy of production database. Achieved using Asynchronous replication from primary RDS instance to read replica. We can use read replica primarily for read heavy database workloads.

- Used for scaling not used for DR (Disaster Recovery).

- Must have automatic backup turned on in order to deploy a read replica.

- We can have upto 5 read replica copies of any database.

- We can have read replicas of read replicas.

- Each read replica has its own DNS end point.

- We can have read replicas that have multi AZ.

- We can have read replicas of Multi AZ source databases.

- Read replicas can be promoted to be their own databases. This breaks the replication.

- We can have read replica in second region.
